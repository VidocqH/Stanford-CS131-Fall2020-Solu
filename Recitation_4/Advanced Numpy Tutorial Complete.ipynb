Saves you time as a programmer: when using lists, you have to use loops to apply a function to each element of an array.  In numpy, all common mathematical computations can be vectorized.  This leads to a much faster runtime, as well as fewer lines of code. \n","\n","2.

Python lists have special functionality where their elements don't all have to be of the same type.
